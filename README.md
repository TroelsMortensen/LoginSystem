# Login System
This example is a simple login system. 
You can:
1. Log in, transfering to a logged in screen
2. Create a new user
3. Change the password of an existing user

It uses our JavaFX MVVM structure, with four different views.
The model is responsible for various validation checks and maintaining a list of (initially hardcoded) valid users.
